{"data":{"name":"Pa amb tomaquet","status":"#minirecipe\nPa amb tomaquet\n\nThis is a great way to use up old bread and add more veggies to your menu. Slice some old bread, not too thin, and toast. Peel a clove of garlic and rub the toasted slices. Drip some good EV olive oil on the bread and add chopped tomatoes (if they have lots of seeds, deseed first or it\u0026rsquo;ll become too wet). Sprinkle with salt.\nOften served as a starter. but I think these make a nice lunch too. In Italy they\u0026rsquo;re called bruschette.","scheduled_at":"2022-11-15T06:00:00Z"}}
