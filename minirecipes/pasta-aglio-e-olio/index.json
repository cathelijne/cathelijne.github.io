{"data":{"name":"Pasta aglio e olio","status":"#minirecipe\nPasta aglio e olio\n\nBoil pasta in less water than usual that\u0026rsquo;s well-salted. In the meantime, slice garlic as fine as possible, 1/2-1 clove per person and fry with some crushed peperoncini to taste in a generous splash of olive oil, making sure it doesn\u0026rsquo;t burn. When the pasta is almost al dente, drain, keep the water! Add a few tbsp of the water to the oil/garlic for an almost creamy consistency. Add pasta and heat. Top with chopped parseley, grated parmesan, extra ev olive oil and s\u0026amp;p to taste.","scheduled_at":"2022-11-03T06:00:00Z"}}
