  Is it possible to use an iPad for serious work? Can you leave your computer at home when you go on vacation and do everything you need on an iPad? I bought an iPad Air (4th generation) last year for photo-editing on the road, watching the occasional movie, reading the paper, anything that makes you want to have a bit bigger screen than a phone.

Just a big phone?</h2><p>I&rsquo;ve never been a fan of tablets. Over the years, I&rsquo;ve owned several, but they all ended up as gaming screens for my kid. Until he got a Nintendo Switch, that is. Mostly they are built on less powerful hardware than my phone. And then I&rsquo;d rather use my phone.</p><p>But Apple, I hear you say. But I&rsquo;m not a big fan of Apple. Yes, I own (and love!) a MacBook (It runs Unix! And Lightroom! The screen is fabulous!), but their mobile machines are too closed and the App Store is full of paid apps that do the same or less than the free alternatives I can run on my laptop. And editing photos still sucked. So in the end I just brought my laptop with me. On vacation. On family visits. Even for an afternoon.</p><h2 id=laptops-are-for-work>Laptops are for work</h2><p>The trouble with bringing a laptop, is that I start <em>working</em> on it. Indeed, on vacation. On family visits. Even for an afternoon. What can I say? I love my job, and sometimes you just have that one deployment in your cluster that keeps having issues, and it can&rsquo;t hurt to have a look while the rest watches Netflix, can it? And being able to cull your photos the day you shot them is priceless. As is the possibilty to upload them to the cloud, so in case anything happens, you still have the photos. Yeah, right.</p><p>In recent years, Adobe have made major improvements to their mobile apps. And Apple have done their best to make their tablets attractive with a good range of models and the ability to use it as an extra screen for your laptop (who doesn&rsquo;t need a bit of extra room on their screens) I figured I&rsquo;d try one more time to actually <em>use</em> a tablet. I bought an iPad Air 4. And then we all stayed home again. Because Covid. I didn&rsquo;t use the iPad much, but found it&rsquo;s a great preview screen when doing studio photography. Lightroom is very usable. It works well with an old Bluetooth Magic Keyboard and a mini Bluetooth mouse. And I figured, for photography, I don&rsquo;t need to bring my laptop on trips anymore.</p><h2 id=laptopless>Laptopless</h2><p>On a recent trip to Lisbon (<em>do</em> visit if you have the chance, awesome city!) I decided to only take the iPad. Nice. I didn&rsquo;t work. I edited some photos. We watched Netflix only once (did I mention that Lisbon is a great city?), and because you can download movies on a mobile device, it didn&rsquo;t matter that the hotel WiFi was a bit crowded in the evenings. I had told my colleagues that doing stuff was out of the question, no laptop, so don&rsquo;t bother calling.</p><p>And then a friend called. Years ago, I had written a bunch of webhooks to deploy from Github (way before Actions were any good), and it stopped working. I tried to investigate on the iPad, and&mldr; meh. SSH over patchy networks is no fun. The shell I was using didn&rsquo;t support copy and paste. The old keyboard and mini mouse were big and bulky. I was able to diagnose the problem (they were still using a very old RSA key for deployments), but couldn&rsquo;t do much to fix it with my current setup.</p><h2 id=a-working-setup>A working setup</h2><p>It was not a pressing issue. Fixing it after I got back was perfectly fine, but it did make me wonder&mldr; Can I use my iPad to fix small issues like this? And what would I need for that?</p><p>For a start, I compiled a very short list of things I&rsquo;d need:</p><ul><li>Reliable shell access<ul><li>with copy and paste</li></ul></li><li>Check out git repositories</li><li>An offline editor with code highlighting</li><li>Nice to have: A keyboard no bigger than the form factor of the iPad itself</li></ul><p>Next up: Shell</p></div></div></div><footer><div>Copyright Â© 2023 Cathelijne Hornstra</div><nav class="home social"><ul><li class=sticky><a href=mailto:websitemessage@hornstra.com title=mail><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 512 512"><path d="M0 128C0 92.65 28.65 64 64 64H448c35.3.0 64 28.65 64 64V384c0 35.3-28.7 64-64 64H64c-35.35.0-64-28.7-64-64V128zm48 0v22.1L220.5 291.7c20.6 17 50.4 17 71 0L464 150.1v-23C464 119.2 456.8 111.1 448 111.1H64C55.16 111.1 48 119.2 48 127.1V128zm0 84.2V384C48 392.8 55.16 4e2 64 4e2H448C456.8 4e2 464 392.8 464 384V212.2L322 328.8c-38.4 31.5-93.6 31.5-132.9.0L48 212.2z"/></svg></a></li><li class=sticky><a href=https://github.com/cathelijne title=github><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 480 512"><path d="M186.1 328.7c0 20.9-10.9 55.1-36.7 55.1s-36.7-34.2-36.7-55.1 10.9-55.1 36.7-55.1 36.7 34.2 36.7 55.1zM480 278.2c0 31.9-3.2 65.7-17.5 95-37.9 76.6-142.1 74.8-216.7 74.8-75.8.0-186.2 2.7-225.6-74.8-14.6-29-20.2-63.1-20.2-95 0-41.9 13.9-81.5 41.5-113.6-5.2-15.8-7.7-32.4-7.7-48.8.0-21.5 4.9-32.3 14.6-51.8 45.3.0 74.3 9 108.8 36 29-6.9 58.8-10 88.7-10 27 0 54.2 2.9 80.4 9.2 34-26.7 63-35.2 107.8-35.2 9.8 19.5 14.6 30.3 14.6 51.8.0 16.4-2.6 32.7-7.7 48.2 27.5 32.4 39 72.3 39 114.2zm-64.3 50.5c0-43.9-26.7-82.6-73.5-82.6-18.9.0-37 3.4-56 6-14.9 2.3-29.8 3.2-45.1 3.2-15.2.0-30.1-.9-45.1-3.2-18.7-2.6-37-6-56-6-46.8.0-73.5 38.7-73.5 82.6.0 87.8 80.4 101.3 150.4 101.3h48.2c70.3.0 150.6-13.4 150.6-101.3zm-82.6-55.1c-25.8.0-36.7 34.2-36.7 55.1s10.9 55.1 36.7 55.1 36.7-34.2 36.7-55.1-10.9-55.1-36.7-55.1z"/></svg></a></li><li class=sticky><a href=https://mastodon.nl/@lijn rel=me title=mastodon><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 448 512"><path d="M433 179.11c0-97.2-63.71-125.7-63.71-125.7-62.52-28.7-228.56-28.4-290.48.0.0.0-63.72 28.5-63.72 125.7.0 115.7-6.6 259.4 105.63 289.1 40.51 10.7 75.32 13 103.33 11.4 50.81-2.8 79.32-18.1 79.32-18.1l-1.7-36.9s-36.31 11.4-77.12 10.1c-40.41-1.4-83-4.4-89.63-54a102.54 102.54.0 01-.9-13.9c85.63 20.9 158.65 9.1 178.75 6.7 56.12-6.7 105-41.3 111.23-72.9 9.8-49.8 9-121.5 9-121.5zm-75.12 125.2h-46.63v-114.2c0-49.7-64-51.6-64 6.9v62.5h-46.33V197c0-58.5-64-56.6-64-6.9v114.2H90.19c0-122.1-5.2-147.9 18.41-175 25.9-28.9 79.82-30.8 103.83 6.1l11.6 19.5 11.6-19.5c24.11-37.1 78.12-34.8 103.83-6.1 23.71 27.3 18.4 53 18.4 175z"/></svg></a></li><li class=sticky><a href=https://linkedin.com/in/cathelijne title=linkedin><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 448 512"><path d="M416 32H31.9C14.3 32 0 46.5.0 64.3v383.4C0 465.5 14.3 480 31.9 480H416c17.6.0 32-14.5 32-32.3V64.3c0-17.8-14.4-32.3-32-32.3zM135.4 416H69V202.2h66.5V416zm-33.2-243c-21.3.0-38.5-17.3-38.5-38.5S80.9 96 102.2 96c21.2.0 38.5 17.3 38.5 38.5.0 21.3-17.2 38.5-38.5 38.5zm282.1 243h-66.4V312c0-24.8-.5-56.7-34.5-56.7-34.6.0-39.9 27-39.9 54.9V416h-66.4V202.2h63.7v29.2h.9c8.9-16.8 30.6-34.5 62.9-34.5 67.2.0 79.7 44.3 79.7 101.9V416z"/></svg></a></li></ul></nav></footer></div></div><script data-goatcounter=https://pepperlink.goatcounter.com/count async src=//gc.zgo.at/count.js></script><noscript><img src="https://pepperlink.goatcounter.com/count?p=pixel&t=pixel"></noscript></body></html>
